    <h1><u title="*To a certain degree.">I <b>HATE</b> Copyright</u>.</h1>
    <p>Yes, you read that correctly, I dislike copyright. Despite my repository using <a href="https://github.com/RedSQL/redsql.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License</a> which requires copyright notice preservation, I hate copyright, however, only to a certain degree. A really, <b>really</b> certain degree. It's great in a sense that, the original works which you or someone else might create, are protected and secured by a law. This is where <b>copyright abuse</b> comes in...</p>
    <p><span class="pers2">"But <u title="My nick is Red, btw, in case you are wondering.">Red</u>!"</span> I can hear you asking. <span class="pers2">"It's not really abuse, technically or actually! It's all well and <b>legal</b>, therefore it cannot be classified as an abuse!".</span> And... You'd be somewhat right. It's not illegal, however, is it ethical? Is it <b>really</b> ethical, when copyrighted deviations are <i>so</i> overprotected, that borderline looking just a little bit funny at a copyrighted work can cause a lawsuit? Is it <b><i>really</i></b> fair, when perfectly fine uses of fair use can be thrown away by a plaintiff because "but muh copywite!"? Is it <b>fun</b>, when you want to show appreciation to a show, a piece of art, a piece of music, or else by doing your own derived work, only to be slapped by owners of that thing with a "but ouw copywite!!11"? Just, imagine for a moment that you like a certain piece of work, and you want to make your own variation of it. You put effort in, you waste your own time, you try to perfect it... And then your fellow <u title="Lawyers, legal team, you name it.">buddies in suits</u> knock on your door and ask you to seize whatever you are doing. Would it be easy for you to just void all the effort you have put into a project, that you liked for so long? Don't think so.</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"But that's their right!"</h3>
    <p>But that's my derived work? But that's my interpretation of that piece material? But that's my effort I put in? But that's my appreciation to original owners for creating something so good, that I had to create my own derived version because of it? Just because it's their right, does not mean it is <i>rightfully</i> so.</p>
    <p>I know that it's "their right!". I am very aware. But don't you think that's a little too much rights they are getting? Why don't end user get an equal amount of rights?</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"But you don't have those rights to the eyes of law? What are you on about?"</h3>
    <p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexactly.</i> You know what that means, right? Maybe... Just, maybe... <b>non-owners in the eyes of copyright law don't have enough rights?</b> The amount of rights owners and users get are <b><i>massively</b></i> disproportionate. Pretty much doing <i>anything</i> with a copyrighted work is often <b>illegal</b> and copyright owners are in the full right to do whatever they see fit with a user. Even <u title="I guess you can say it's... Unfair Use!">fair use</u> is sometimes slacking in terms of protection towards users!</p>
    <p>Let me reiterate: I <b>know</b> and I am very well <b>aware</b> that users don't have as much rights as owners do. However, the point of this page is, do owners <i>really</i> deserve that much rights compared to standard users?</p>
    <h3 class="pers2" title="FYI, just because it's a law, does not mean it should be that way.">"Wait. So you are a sussy who can't get over a simple law?"</h3>
    <p>First off, no. I am a dude who wants a law to be better, to be equal to both copyright <b>owners</b> and <b>users</b>. This blog entry is <b>not</b> because I want copyright law completely gone. Just, no. I want users to have more rights as compared to owners, because at the current moment, copyright owners get simply too much rights, perhaps way too much than they'd like. Second, "copyright" is in no way "simple law", quite the contrary, it's complex, hard to understand and not simple or straightforward at all. This is why people get lawyers in order to help them resolve copyright issues, because no non-lawyer human being will be able to understand what the actual hell this law is.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/enyay">Tom Scott</a> made a pretty good video regarding that. However I have a slight gripe with it... Seriously, copyright retention shortening only by a few tens of years? Yeah, no, sorry, it's not that simple, it won't fix the other leaky mess within the copyright law, such as <b>ownership abuse</b>. (He also denied changes towards Fair Use law, justifying it by "content creators and art is wild and it's gonna be too complex for fair use to be written like that" or something among those lines. I <b>disagree</b>. But that's mainly because I have more liberal takes as compared to Tom's conservatism.) For that, copyright law needs to be rewritten in a way, which grants owners <i>and</i> users equal rights as to what can be done with copyrighted work and whatnot. Because, at the current moment, the amount of <u title="Basically, owners get everything, and users get a flaky, barely functioning fair use which sometimes doesn't even work.">rights owners and users get are <b>massively</b> disproportionate</u>.</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"So what? Sometimes, laws are just unfair. Deal with it."</h3>
    <p>Indeed, a lot of laws can sometimes be outright <u title="Bullsh*t">BS</u>. A lot of laws sometimes don't even make sense, maybe in theory, but not in practice. They can be really harsh, punishing and unfair towards everyone. As an example, <u title="Author could not properly verify such information. This is may, or may not be true. Take it with a grain of salt.">allegedly (!)</u> there is a law in Germany that makes <i>any</i> public domain usage <b>illegal</b>, and authors <b>must</b> retain their copyright and stand their ground. This is not only disrespectful towards every <u title="A copyright-less work, where author does not retain any sort of copyright and dedicates their work to good faith in public usage.">public domain</u> work, but to every beginner gamedev, content creator or an artist who needs may not have resources to get certain material for their projects. No offense, Germany, but you need to <i>chill the hell out</i>.</p>
    <p>However, "deal with it?"... Yeah, uh, no, sorry. I want this world to be an overall better place, where laws actually make sense and are fair to both parties. I do not want to sit in silence, just taking it all in for eternity. If a law is unfair, I'll call it what it is - unfair. How about we stop just complying with something broken, and let higher-ups know, that some things need <i>updating</i>? Most of the laws were written back in 20th and even earlier centuries. If you have a functioning brain, you might realize that... it was <i>hella</i> long ago! And, as a consequence, a lot of things changed since then. We adapt laws to modern standards in order for them to function properly. So <i>why copyright law should be any different?</i>.</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"So what? You have fair use. You have your rights."</h3>
    <p>True. We indeed have a Fair Use law which supposedly evens out amount of rights copyright owners get and amount of rights end users get. However, it became <i>largely outdated</i>, and not up to speed with modern standards. It's definitions of what is considered "fair use" are extremely vague, and does not entitle end users with proper amount of rights compared to what copyright owners get. The only thing we have there as a defense is "criticism". And even then, it doesn't always work like it should.</p>
    <p>In any case, let's take a look at <i>how</i> exactly the law is abused.</p>
    <h1>From Youtuber-Journalist to a goner.</h1>
    <p>If any of you were following the news for the last 5 years, you might have heard of a situation that has happened between a Youtuber <a href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/SupMatto" title="I'd link his channel. Unfortunately, he has been terminated by your fellow friends.">Supmatto</a> and a <u title="Simply saying their NAME might get me into trouble. Do you understand how bad the situation is now?">gaming publisher which owns a gaming company</u>. To cut long story short, Supmatto reports on something that has happened <i>publicly</i> on a public platform, a <i title="You know who you are.">certain game publisher</i> did not like that, sends private investigators to Supmatto's house, intimidates him and eventually gets his channel <b>terminated</b> from Youtube. Later, it is all justified by a simple comment from their <u title="Yep. That's right. They threw their subsidiary company under the bus instead of going out themselves.">game company they own</u>. Search it up, it's like a 3rd result on <u title="DuckDuckGo">DDG</u>.</p>
    <h3>What happened to him?</h3>
    <p>Nobody knows. Most likely, he was intimidated to be forcebly up on a <u title="Non-Disclosure Agreement. Also known as: a deal with the devil.">NDA</u>, hence we haven't heard from him since. It's scary to think what big corporations can do these days, and after all that, just get away with it scott-free.</p>
    <h3>More cases of similar things happening (From the same publisher).</h3>
    <p>In the March of 2020, news broke out that the same game publisher was up to the same stuff again. This time, they have started a suit against a game modder, who wanted to enhance one of publishers' games. In the legal document they have filed to court, they have stated multiple things about a modder, to which modder has denied such accusations. Furthermore, news articles who have reported on the situation also mentioned a comment from the modder which explained how the game publisher employees harassed him, <u title="What does his family has to do with any of this?">and his family</u>, all because he did a mod for a videogame of theirs. I'd like to mention that, as it turns out, in USA, this is <b><u title="You see where I'm coming from now?">perfectly legal</u></b>.</p>
    <p><u title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</u>, this game publisher already had some clashing between this same game modder before. I don't think I need to mention how their other interaction went by.</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"But what does this have to do anything with the copyright law?"</h3>
    <p>You see, if you've been paying attention, it is, apparently, <b>perfectly legal</b> to "harass" an individual, or their family, over a video game modification. All because it's a "necessary action" to "protect" their <u title="Individual Property. Except it's not individual, it's corporate property.">IP</u>. This is unacceptable, no matter how you look at it. Legal? Yeah. Ethical? Moral? No, not a single bit lmao.</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"I still don't see how this relates to copyright."</h3>
    <p>Copyright law should not grant you a pass to harass individuals over your IP. And after all that, be let away scott-free. Copyright law should also not punish you for a work modification in good faith. You know how many good mods out there with the companies which don't take them out? Good faith modifications should be legal.</p>
    <p>But that's just scratching the surface.</p>
    <h3>More cases from other companies</h3>
    <p><u title="As of 2020-06-24">A few weeks ago</u>, an extension developer got hit by a lawsuit which demanded for their website to be removed from an extension. I should note that that extension bypassed those annoying "compliance" shorteners, which make you wait a few seconds, sometimes solve captcha to proceed, while force fist-feeding you scam advertisements towards things like <b>gambling</b>,<b>pyramid schemes</b>,<b>get-rich-quick schemes</b> and etc. Annoying, right? Well, this is no longer possible.</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"What do you mean 'no longer possible'? What happened?"</h3>
    <p>Extension developer <s><u title="Previously assumed defeat, before getting more info.">lost</u></s> came to an agreement with them, and had to remove such bypass rule from an extension. Why the hell bypassing copyrighted pages is considered a copyright violation??? As I think about it, I knew that copyright system was broken... But not THIS much!?</p>
    <h3>You picked up a screwdriver? Nice copyright violation, fella!</h3>
    <p>Apparently, modifying a product that you have bought <b>yourself</b> on your <b>own money</b> to <b>own</b> the product is illegal. According to <u title="Hint: their name rhymes with 'Crescendo'.">Japanese video game developer and publisher</u>, modifying their product once <b>you</b> own a copy of it is illegal. That's right fellas, you borderline violate copyright law when you pick up a simple tool such a screwdriver! What now? Touching the product wrong way will spark a new wave of lawsuits, ala "copyright violation"? Though I probably should not give them ideas...</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"What about public domain? Just use that!"</h3>
    <p>Indeed, public domain is amazing. However, if you actually read this page and not skimmed over it, allegedyly (!) there is a law in Germany which makes public domain uses illegal. In the world where public domain is considered a norm, it is allegedly (!!) outlawed in Germany.</p>
    <p>Still, using public domain material alone won't get you that far. What should be done, is copyright law should be rewritten, where both parties (end user and owners) get equal amount of rights on what they can do with their work. Right now, it's overprotecting owners, and not giving users much choice.</p>
    <!-- THIS SECTION IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS!!! THIS MIGHT GET MORE POINTS, OR GET SOME REMOVED IN THE FUTURE!!! SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!! -->
    <h2>General irks with copyright.</h2>
    <h3>Licenses, licenses, licenses.</h3>
    <p>Did you know that to record a song cover, you need <b>at least 2 licenses</b>? Yes! You need <b>2 licenses</b> to perform a cover of your favourite song. One is for the melody itself, so you can use it. And the second is for a "cover license", which only then grants you an ability to cover the song to your liking. I don't think I should really mention that licenses aren't cheap, do I? Why the hell do you need a license, in order to do transformative work?! I don't understand the current "melody" licensing either. Because it licenses the <b>entire note arrangement itself</b> regardless of where it is played. No, not a specific sound / instrument with a certain melody played on it, the darn <b>note arrangement</b>. Don't get me wrong, it is fine to retain copyright for melody. But pressing rights when that melody has been transformed to something else? Sorry, no.</p>
    <p>Almost forgot to mention, things like TV show and movie licenses... Aren't actually universal. There isn't a unifying license standard which would make publishers obide, and issue 1 unifying license for all countries that opt into obiding it. This is why your favourite show on your favourite streaming service isn't available in your country. That's because publishers are <b>greedy punks</b>, who try to get maximum profit from companies who provide streaming services, by making them pay for multiple licenses in multiple countries despite already owning a license for the same content they paid for broadcasting a show in a first country they got license for. So next time, when a new good show isn't available in your region, blame greedy publishers and copyright holders for that, instead of your streaming service provider. While sure, they can buy more licenses, the entire "licensing" thing is <b>fundementally flawed</b>.</p>
    <p>While I understand that licensing is a (sometimes necessary) key, in order for publishers / copyright holders and service providers / end users to have a good relationship and a fair share of either revenue, or a fair use of the products. However, as you can see, <b>that has been abused as well</b>. Because of that, I have stopped associating licensing with a "right to use a product / service", and started associating it with "method of getting as much money as possible". 1 License is fine, 50 of them isn't.</p>
    <h3>Last commit: 1998</h3>
    <p>Last time a copyright law in US has been updated was <b>1998</b>. To put it into perspective, as of 2020: that was <b>22 years ago</b>. I don't really know how about you, but I think it's time for an upgrade. 1998 Might seem recent enough, but trust me, this is pretty outdated. In 1998, things were still developing, and technology was just making its progress. We are now past that period, and more-or-less settled with something... for now. Latest <u title="Digital Millenium Copyright Act">DMCA</u> revision is outdated, and is not suited well for modern standards.</p>
    <h3>(Un)Fair use</h3>
    <p>Since latest revision was in 1998, Fair Use has became outdated as well. It only adheres to standards of late 90s, and early technology adoption, which, call me out if you will, but I think we are long past that. Fair Use needs an update, which would grant consumers / end users with more rights, regarding with copyright protected products or services. Right now, only uses for (un)Fair Use are either criticism, or something "transformative".</p>
    <h3 class="pers2">"Wait... What do you mean 'transofrmative'?"</h3>
    <p>Dang, I don't know. Ask court about that, given you have money, time and patience for everything ;)</p>
    <h3>OK, Fair Use, but how about Fair Revenue split?</h3>
    <p>Right now, at least on YouTube, copyright holders can claim <b>100%</b> of your revenue, if you dare to show or play 1 second of their music or work. I think we can at least agree that, while legal, is not a fair revenue split for a content creator and copyright holder. Content creators and copyright holders should be able to split their revenue on what they earn on their work. While 50/50 split for revenue made within a timeframe of the copyrighted work being shown sounds reasonable, I am pretty sure major companies / corporations would beg to differ :)</p>
    <p>I know what you might be thinking. It might look like I am defending channels and their revenue, who are blindly reuploading the music, in order to "promote" it. And to that I say: <b>Hell</b>. <b>No</b>. They are, at best, with me being overtly generous, <b>maybe</b> deserve like... 2%? In the best case scenario, and if they put something into a video, maybe like audio visualizer or something. But <b>no more</b> than 2%. I am sorry, but for that you have to talk directly with publishers regarding promotion and revenue arrangements. Spoiler: they won't license you anything if you have 100 subscriber YouTube channel with basic audio visualizers.</p>
    <h3>Game mods</h3>
    <p>According to copyright law, modding your game is actually <b>illegal</b>, because it violates the rights of copyright holders to whom the game content or code belongs to. You heard that right, your mod which can <b>fix the game</b>, because developers have been neglient with the game and instead of fixing themselves they did nothing, is in fact <b>illegal</b> and you can be sued for it.</p>
    <p>OK, I do understand multiplayer games, they rely on good experience within the playerbase. But is it really cheater's fault for cheating in your game? No, I mean, he does most likely suck at the game, so he resorts to low-end things like that. But, first off, as a big company, can't you, like, develop a good anti-cheat? Second, is it really worth and ethical to screw over players who play singleplayer games because of that? Maybe we should define that, if a certain game utilizes concurrent, active, communicative users online, then it abides to "no-modifying" law. If a game does not contain that, maybe that portion of it should be exempt from being illegal to modify? Just my 2c.</p>
    <h1>Bottom line</h1>
    <p>Thank you for taking your time to read this article. I should probably re-iterate (again) that this is still <b>work in progress</b> and might have a lot of missing information, unfinished thoughts and other stuff that might not be considered complete or "cooked" enough. I will update this page from time to time, adding new stuff, removing old stuff and other housekeeping types-of-things. But for now, I think I conveyed the main thought.</p>
    <p>To summarize:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I think that copyright law should be rewritten from ground up, to even out amount of rights owner gets, and amount of rights the end user gets.</li>
        <li>I think fair use should be opened up more to a broader definition. It has became <b>too vague</b> to modern standards.</li>
        <li>I think that Copyright law should have a good faith side to it. Right now, it overprotects the owners and screws over end user.</li>
        <li>I think that end user should not be punished for good faith works. I don't know how about you, but lawsuits over game modifications sound ridiculous.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would like to once again, apologize, because I barely linked anything in this article. However, please do understand that I did that over <b>copyright concerns</b>. Now, can we please fix copyright in a way, where I don't have to fear linking information over a broken law, hm? :-)</p>
    <p>There is currently no comments, as I'm still exploring the options I have for a good comment system.</p>
