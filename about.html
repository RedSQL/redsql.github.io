		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Mike and I go by online names like "Red", "RedSQL" or "RedEclipse". What a 'masterpiece' of a page / website you are seeing right about now is my dumpster where I dump all sorts of content from time to time.</p>
		<p>I am not usually the one to talk much about my personal life and whatever goes on. However, things like my opinions, thoughts and analysis pieces could be found over at my <a href="blog">blog</a>. I post there from time to time, periodically. And even sometimes I manage to revise a few posts!</p>
		<p>Here is a few fun facts about me:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>I am a <abbr title="Or GNU/Linux, if you prefer.">Linux</abbr> user. I run Manjaro Linux dualbooted with Windows 10 on my main machine. I do most of my work on Linux and practically have no issues with that. I do, however, periodically boot into Windows to play certain games that are unfeasable to play on Linux, or I just want to play without doing much troubleshooting.</p></li>
			<li><p>Extending to the last point - All distros are great for their own purposes. Seriously, stop bagging on people who use a distro <i>you</i> personally don't like.</p></li>
			<!-- i hope everyone will catch this joke lol -->
			<li><p>Ubuntu is bad and you should feel bad for using it.</p></li>
			<li><p>I'm an avid VR player.</p></li>
			<li><p>I'm a (very crappy one at that) developer.</p></li>
			<li><p>My sleep schedule is absolute garbage. (Although I like it)</p></li>
			<li><p>My sense of humour is an absolute nightmare. Say "cheese" to me straight into the face and I'll laugh my arse off. No, I'm serious.</p></li>
			<li><p>I sometimes have... Ehhh... <i>Pretty controversial</i> takes on certain things. Though you might not ever see them with the current state of public accepting other opinions...</p></li>
			<li><p>I hate copyright.</p></li>
			<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">RMS</a> while sometimes could be seen as controversial, more often than not misunderstood. I respect his ability to publicly state opinions on things.</p></li>
			<li><p>I am a serious open source advocate.</p></li>
			<li><p>I'm an introvert.</p></li>
			<li><p>I'm anti-social.</p></li>
			<li><p>I consider DRM to be a plague.</p></li>
			<li><p>I think Twitter is the least social platform out of all social media platforms out there. That website is nothing but a hateful circlejerk machine which brings nothing but absolute misery. Avoid posting in it, interacting with it or in any way shape or form looking at it. Seriously, quit it. Take it from somebody who quit Twitter for a long time. It seriously improves your mental well-being in the long run.</p></li>
			<li><p>I am a strong advocate for freelancing in every job position that is possible to freelance on. Let's stop stagnating with old rules!</p></li>
			<li><p>I consider today's world (as of 2021) to be the most stagnant and the least modern world possible.</p></li>
			<li><p>I always welcome feedback from other people to any of my work that I am doing, especially the ones that are open-sourced.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>So yeah, that about wraps everything I want to share about me so far. That's fine if you disagree with any of my opinions. I am not expecting everyone to agree with what I am saying. If you have any valuable feedback, please <a href="https://github.com/RedSQL/redsql.github.io/issues/new">drop it by</a> and I'll try my best to improve upon it!</p>
