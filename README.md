# Contributing
For honest disclosure - I am not a very good coder. Sometimes, my code can be a little bit messy from time to time, and *you* can improve it! Simply open a PR with your improvements, and I'll review and merge them accordingly. As a bonus, or a good gesture for contributing per se, you will be noted in [acknowledgements page](https://redsql.github.io/acknowledgements.html) with a link to your GitHub profile! (If I won't forget to do that, that is.) If you want your nickname removed (for some / any reason), [open an issue](https://github.com/RedSQL/redsql.github.io/issues) and I'll remove it ASAP.
