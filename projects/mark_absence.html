				Why did he leave the server?
			</summary>
				Short answer: I don't know.
				<br><br>
				Longer answer: Mark has this tendency to... Randomly leave our server, sometimes outright for no apparent reason. He usually doesn't leave any notice about him leaving and reasons for doing so. This sole purpose of this page is just to see the amount of time that Mark has been gone from the server since he left. He might come back... At some point... Eventually... At least I am hoping that would be the case.

			<summary>
				When he will come back?
			</summary>
				I don't know. Just whenever he feels like it.
